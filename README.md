# Linux Mint Quick Start

This is a quick start script to set up Linux Mint Cinnamon the way I like it:

* It installs the Brave Browser and disables all the annoying Brave "features" like crypto, VPN, etc, and just leaves the basic browser with ad blocking and privacy features.
* It uninstalls LibreOffice, replacing it with OnlyOffice. For most people I know coming from MS Office, OnlyOffice is much closer to their experience. It reduced friction for the end user.
* It installs VLC Media Player and associates it with most media types.

Don't run this script unless you review it, and know what you're doing. But here's a one-liner from the command prompt:

```
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlipperPA/linux-mint-quick-start/main/install.sh | sh
```
